# Import your newly installed selenium package

from selenium import webdriver



# Now create an 'instance' of your driver

# This path should be to wherever you downloaded the driver

driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path="/Users/dale/Downloads/chromedriver")

# A new Chrome (or other browser) window should open up



# Now just tell it wherever you want it to go

driver.get("https://medium.com/@dalewahl")

# Return the title

# Good to use assert clause to make sure you are where you think you are

driver.title



# Navigate back and forward with the browser buttons just like a real human!

driver.back()

driver.forward()



# Save a screenshot; check and see what was going on or capture something specific

driver.save_screenshot('test_shot.png')



# Ah, pull all the code onto your machine

driver.page_source

# This is where you get that sweet, sweet data

# Sort it with some BeautifulSoup tools and store it away!



# You'll also likely want to move around and click some links

driver.find_element_by_link_text('text you want to find')

driver.find_element_by_partial_link_text('part of the text')

# add an 's' to element if you want to return a whole list of elements



# Add this method to click it!

driver.find_element_by_link_text('text you want to find').click()



# You also may want to type into fields

driver.find_element_by_name('textbox).send_keys('type this in, robot')



# Here are some other things you may want to find (look for them in the HTML code):

.find_element_by_id()

.find_element_by_name()

.find_element_by_xpath()

.find_element_by_tag_name()

.find_element_by_class_name()

.find_element_by_css_selector()



#Finally, don't forgot to close your webdriver when done

driver.close()
